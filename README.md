# Project Summary -
The analysis of the hotel bookings dataset has provided valuable insights into various aspects of the hotel industry. Here is a summary of the key findings:

**Number of Canceled Bookings:** By analyzing the dataset, we found the total number of bookings that were canceled. This information is crucial for understanding booking trends and managing reservation processes effectively.

**Booking Ratio Between Resort Hotel and City Hotel:** We examined the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel. This analysis helps in understanding the demand and popularity of each hotel type and can guide strategic decisions related to marketing and resource allocation.

**Bookings on Weekdays vs Weekends**: We explored the distribution of bookings on weekdays versus weekends. This information can help identify patterns in customer behavior and optimize hotel operations based on the demand fluctuations throughout the week.

**Revenue of the Hotels**: We calculated the revenue generated by the hotels by multiplying the average daily rate (ADR) with the number of nights stayed. This analysis provides insights into the financial performance of the hotels and helps in assessing their profitability.

**Hotels Available for Booking:** We examined the availability of hotels for booking. This analysis is important for understanding the capacity and occupancy rates of the hotels and can inform strategies for managing room availability and maximizing revenue.

**Bookings Across Years:** We analyzed the total number of bookings across different years. This analysis helps in identifying booking trends over time and can guide long-term planning and forecasting.

**Total Revenue Across Years Split by Hotel Type:** We visualized the total revenue generated by each hotel type across different years. This analysis provides insights into the financial performance of each hotel type over time and helps in assessing their revenue growth and profitability.

**Guests' Country of Origin:** We determined the country from which most guests come. This information is useful for understanding the hotel's customer base and can guide marketing efforts and guest services catering to specific nationalities.

**Duration of Stay:** We analyzed how long people stay in the hotel by calculating the total number of nights stayed. This analysis helps in understanding guest preferences and can inform pricing strategies, package offerings, and guest experience enhancements.

Overall, the analysis of the hotel bookings dataset has provided valuable insights that can contribute to making informed business decisions in the hotel industry. The findings can guide marketing strategies, resource allocation, revenue optimization, and customer service enhancements, leading to improved operational efficiency and positive business impact.
